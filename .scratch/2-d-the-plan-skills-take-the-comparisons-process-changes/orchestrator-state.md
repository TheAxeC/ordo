# Orchestrator state (read this first after any context compaction, or as a new orchestrator)

The catch-up note for entry 2.D of `docs/roadmap.md`, the plan skills take the comparison's process changes. Rewritten before every step commit. Everything here is also derivable from `plan.md`, the roadmap, the repository's instruction file and `git log`, but slower. Read this, then `plan.md`, then the tail of the transcript when there is one. Nothing needed to continue lives anywhere but this folder: another Claude Code session continues from these files alone.

## Open items (only what the user must rule on: a stop, and a proposal of the recurring-findings pass; repeated verbatim after the position line of the orchestrator's reports and the landing report until ruled)

None.

## Closed items (the log of what was raised and how it ended; no report carries it)

- 2026-09-29: the step list: approved by the user as drafted.
- 2026-09-29: open item B (the implied inputs for product code): ruled (b) by the user; `skills/spec/templates/brief.md` "Cases" and `skills/spec/SKILL.md` Steps 4 say "a code step (a script, or a product's code)", `/spec` 1.6.3, applied on main.
- 2026-09-29: open item A (one trigger per case): ruled (a) by the user, at least one phrase per case and several phrasings allowed; applied on main in `docs/dev/skill-layout.md`, Frontmatter.

## The standing demands (from Axel, in force)

- `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` and the rules under `~/.claude/rules/`. The ones that bite here: work runs through the skills' agents, never inline; scripts compute facts, judgment is read; no claim about state without a command in the same turn; report the end state only; plain prose, ASCII, no hard wraps and no em dashes; open items as plain text with options, pros and cons, one recommendation and the lazy option named; never the lazy option.
- Commits: a capitalised imperative subject and `- Verb` bullets. No attribution of any kind. Never push. A worktree's branch is deleted with the worktree.
- Never edit `~/.local/share/ordo-stable` or the skill links by hand, and never run `utils/pin.sh <tag>` without asking. research-hub is read only. Tests that touch skill folders run under `env -u CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR -u ORDO_SKILL_DIRS -u ORDO_STABLE`.

## Verification, every step

- A landing runs the `land` skill's `templates/land.sh` from the repository root as `sh <the land skill's folder>/templates/land.sh <state file> <step> <base>`. It commits the step's work in its worktree, cherry-picks the range onto main, runs the `verify` list on main through `templates/checks.sh` and prints the booking data. It exits 0 when the step landed and every check passed, 1 on a failed check or a stop, 2 on a conflict and 64 on a refusal, or with git's own status when a git step fails; the `land` skill's `templates/land.test.sh` proves it.
- The `verify` list above runs through `sh skills/land/templates/checks.sh <state file>` from the root of the checkout it checks, the worktree and then main. It prints `$ <command>` and the output of each command, then `checks: <n> commands passed`, and the lines it prints are what a report or a booking quotes.
- The step's own check, named on its line in `plan.md` and in its brief.
- Every step: `LC_ALL=C grep -n '[^ -~]'` over every file the diff touches finds nothing new, and `git status --short` shows nothing of the step's.

## Where things are

- Design: `docs/roadmap.md` entry 2.D, the rulings in `.scratch/comparison-2026-09-28/rulings.md` (the table "Ruled") and `findings-by-cause.md` beside it, and the rulings in `plan.md`. Ledger: `.scratch/2-d-the-plan-skills-take-the-comparisons-process-changes/`, with `agents/briefs/` and `agents/reviews/`.
- The comparison's source repositories were cloned under an earlier session's scratchpad and are not kept; the rulings file quotes what the steps need.
- Nothing running that a step must not disturb.

## Current position (rewritten before every step commit)

- 2026-09-29. Step 4 landed: `/roadmap add` and `/plan` ask "could this pass without the goal being reached?" of every gate and step check, and `/roadmap` has the "Not yet specified" section, which `/plan` refuses.
- Verified: `sh skills/land/templates/checks.sh` on this state file on main, `checks: 7 commands passed`, exit 0.
- Next step: 5, the brief check at `/spec`; its brief check also asks the question of every step's check, so a step a ruling adds is covered (step 4's booking).
- Open on Axel's side: nothing.
