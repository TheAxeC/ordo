# Orchestrator state (read this first after any context compaction, or as a new orchestrator)

The catch-up note for entry 3 of `docs/roadmap.md`, the writing base. Rewritten before every step commit of this plan, so it describes this plan as of its own last resume point (`plan-orchestration`, "Resuming, and handing the plan over"). Everything here is also derivable from `plan.md`, the roadmap, the repository's instruction file and `git log`, but slower. Read this, then `plan.md`, then the tail of the transcript when there is one. Nothing needed to continue lives anywhere but this folder: another Claude Code session continues from these files alone.

```yaml
dispatch: none               # or the block /spec writes (a list when .agents/plan.yaml's workers_at_once is above 1). /spec writes the entry at the end of its preflight with step and `landing: preparing`, writes `"running: <agent id>"` into brief_check while the brief-check agent runs, base after its preparation commit and worktree before it creates the worktree, and fills the entry at its Steps 9, so that it holds: step, executor, worker, worktree (<worktree_root>/<slug>-<step>), base, launched, report (the builder's report, at the path the brief names), brief_check (the brief check's report path, with the agent's id, its served model, tokens, tool uses and time, or `none, a small text step` for a small text step), landing, round. `landing` is `preparing` while /spec runs, then `not-started`, `cherry-picking` while /land cherry-picks, and `backed-out` after a red line took the step back out of main. The orchestrator adds session_id, the builder's agent id followed by the model the runner served it (<agent id> (<served model>)), as soon as the builder is dispatched and its model read, builders_before (the agent id and served model of each builder it replaced, as <agent id> (<served model>, stopped) or <agent id> (<served model>, dead), one after another), builder_usage (the builder's tokens, tool uses and time from its completion notice) beside report when the builder's report is saved, and reviewer_report (the refuter report's path, with each reviewer's agent id, served model, tokens, tool uses and time, or, for a reviewer stopped for another model, its agent id, served model and stopped) at the review. A value that holds `: ` (brief_check while its agent runs, builder_usage after a repair round, reviewer_report after a run over a round) is written in double quotes, so the block stays valid YAML. A diagnosis agent has no key here: the session that starts it writes its id and role into plan.md's Agents section, as the diagnose skill's Rules say. A step dispatched while another in flight, of this plan or of another open plan, names a file its brief also names carries shared_paths: each shared file, the other step's plan and step, and why the merge at landing is simple, as plan-orchestration's "Two steps in flight" says; with no shared file the key is left out.
```

## Open items (only what the user must rule on: a stop, and a proposal of the recurring-findings pass; repeated verbatim after the position line of the orchestrator's reports and the landing report until ruled or, under `self_rule: on`, until the orchestrator closes it as `plan-orchestration`'s `references/self-rule.md`, "Closing an open item", says)

- Step 3, the second run (2026-10-15). The nine `/writing` runs ran once more on tag v8.1.0-rc.2, and the check failed again: six of the eight case reports miss breaks of section-level or whole-draft rules, and all eight report breaks in passages the tables list as clean, most of which the drafts really hold (`agents/reviews/3-gate-reading-run-2.md`). The ruling "Step 3, the case reports" allows no further round.
  - (a), recommended: stop here. Step 3 stays unticked, entry 3 stays open on the roadmap, and tag v8.1.0-rc.2 stays pinned, so `/writing` is in use as it is. Pro: keeps the no-further-round ruling and claims nothing the check did not show. Con: the known misses stay in the skill and entry 3 is not done.
  - (b): change the Gate of entry 3 so the case reports are a record and not a pass condition, then close entry 3 on your reading of the NWO XS report. Pro: entry 3 closes. Con: it reverses an approved gate after it failed, and it marks done a skill that the cases show still misses rules. The lazy option.

## Closed items (the log of what was raised and how it ended; no report carries it)

- Step 2, the case files (2026-10-15): ruled (a), (a) by the user on 2026-10-15; booked in `plan.md` Rulings, with the lines of steps 2 and 3 rewritten.
- Step 2, the brief check (2026-10-15): ruled (a), (a) by the user on 2026-10-15; booked in `plan.md` Rulings, with the line of step 2 rewritten.
- Step 3, the case reports (2026-10-15): ruled (a) by the user on 2026-10-15; booked in `plan.md` Rulings.
- Step 3, how the ruled fix is carried (2026-10-15): ruled (a) by the user on 2026-10-15; booked in `plan.md` Rulings, with the line of step 3 rewritten.

## The standing demands (from Axel, in force)

- `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` and the rules under `~/.claude/rules/`. The ones that bite here: work runs through the skills' agents, never inline; no claim about state without a command in the same turn; report the end state only; plain prose, ASCII, no hard wraps and no em dashes; open items as plain text with options, pros and cons, one recommendation and the lazy option named; never the lazy option; nothing asked of Axel that an agent can do.
- Commits: a capitalised imperative subject and `- Verb` bullets. No attribution of any kind. Never push. A worktree's branch is deleted with the worktree.
- Never edit `~/.local/share/ordo-stable` or the skill links by hand, and never run `utils/pin.sh <tag>` without asking. research-hub is read only. Tests that touch skill folders run under `env -u CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR -u ORDO_SKILL_DIRS -u ORDO_STABLE`.

## Verification, every step

- A landing runs the `land` skill's `templates/land.sh` from the repository root as `sh <the land skill's folder>/templates/land.sh <state file> <slug>-<step> <base>`. It commits the step's work in its worktree, cherry-picks the range onto main, runs the `verify` list on main through `templates/checks.sh` and prints the booking data. It exits 0 when the step landed and every check passed, 1 on a failed check or a stop, 2 on a conflict and 64 on a refusal, 127 when `python3` is not installed, or with git's own status when a git step fails; the `land` skill's `templates/land.test.sh` proves it.
- The step's own check, named on its line in `plan.md` and in its brief, run from the repository root.
- The `verify` list above runs through the `land` skill's `templates/checks.sh <state file>` from the root of main's checkout, once, at landing. It prints `$ <command>` and the output of each command, then `checks: <n> commands passed`, and the lines it prints are what the booking quotes. The builder and the reviewer run the checks the brief names for the files the step changes before landing.
- Every step: `LC_ALL=C grep -n '[^ -~]'` over every file the diff touches outside a ledger's `cases/` folder finds nothing new, and `git status --short` shows nothing of the step's.

## Where things are

- Design: `docs/roadmap.md` entry 3, the rulings in `plan.md`, ADRs 0001 to 0003, the three `rebuild: writing` rows of `docs/academic-coverage.md` and their source files in research-hub. Ledger: `.scratch/3-the-writing-base/`, with `agents/briefs/` and `agents/reviews/`.
- research-hub is read only: the source files and the NWO XS `.docx` are read, never changed.

## Current position (rewritten before every step commit of this plan)

- 2026-10-15. Steps 1 and 2 are landed. Step 3's one repair round is landed: the review agent prompt of `skills/writing/SKILL.md` and the case files.
- Verified: `checks.sh` on main printed `checks: 6 commands passed` after the fixes at landing.
- Tag `v8.1.0-rc.2` is on the landing commit ae05d76 and pinned. The nine `/writing` runs of step 3 run once more, each agent on claude-opus-5-5.
- The nine runs ran; the reading is `agents/reviews/3-gate-reading-run-2.md`, and the check is not met.
- Next step: the user's ruling on the open item "Step 3, the second run".
- Open on Axel's side: his reading of the NWO XS report of the second run for false alarms.
