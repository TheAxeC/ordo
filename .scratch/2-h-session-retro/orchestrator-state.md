# Orchestrator state (read this first after any context compaction, or as a new orchestrator)

The catch-up note for entry 2.H of `docs/roadmap.md`, session-retro. Rewritten before every step commit. Everything here is also derivable from `plan.md`, the roadmap, the repository's instruction file and `git log`, but slower. Read this, then `plan.md`, then the tail of the transcript when there is one. Nothing needed to continue lives anywhere but this folder: another Claude Code session continues from these files alone.

## Open items (only what the user must rule on: a stop, and a proposal of the recurring-findings pass; repeated verbatim after the position line of the orchestrator's reports and the landing report until ruled)

none

## Closed items (the log of what was raised and how it ended; no report carries it)

- Step 2 reading (2026-09-30): approved by Axel with the correction to "The reader"'s opening sentence, made on main as a fix of step 2; step 2 ticked.

- Recurring findings (2026-09-30): Axel ruled (a) for each of the six proposals; step 3a.

- Step 3a, the words of the six changes (2026-09-30): Axel ruled (a); the texts are under "Step 0 of step 3a" in `plan.md`.

## The standing demands (from Axel, in force)

- `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` and the rules under `~/.claude/rules/`. The ones that bite here: work runs through the skills' agents, never inline; scripts compute facts, judgment is read; no claim about state without a command in the same turn; report the end state only; plain prose, ASCII, no hard wraps and no em dashes; open items as plain text with options, pros and cons, one recommendation and the lazy option named; never the lazy option.
- Commits: a capitalised imperative subject and `- Verb` bullets. No attribution of any kind. Never push. A worktree's branch is deleted with the worktree.
- Never edit `~/.local/share/ordo-stable` or the skill links by hand, and never run `utils/pin.sh <tag>` without asking. research-hub is read only. Tests that touch skill folders run under `env -u CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR -u ORDO_SKILL_DIRS -u ORDO_STABLE`.

## Verification, every step

- A landing runs the `land` skill's `templates/land.sh` from the repository root as `sh <the land skill's folder>/templates/land.sh <state file> <step> <base>`. It commits the step's work in its worktree, cherry-picks the range onto main, runs the `verify` list on main through `templates/checks.sh` and prints the booking data. It exits 0 when the step landed and every check passed, 1 on a failed check or a stop, 2 on a conflict and 64 on a refusal, or with git's own status when a git step fails; the `land` skill's `templates/land.test.sh` proves it.
- The `verify` list above runs through `sh skills/land/templates/checks.sh <state file>` from the root of the checkout it checks, the worktree and then main. It prints `$ <command>` and the output of each command, then `checks: <n> commands passed`, and the lines it prints are what a report or a booking quotes.
- The step's own check, named on its line in `plan.md` and in its brief.
- Every step: `LC_ALL=C grep -n '[^ -~]'` over every file the diff touches finds nothing new, and `git status --short` shows nothing of the step's.

## Where things are

- Design: `docs/roadmap.md` entry 2.H and the rulings in `plan.md`. Ledger: `.scratch/2-h-session-retro/`, with `agents/briefs/` and `agents/reviews/`.
- The transcripts under `~/.claude/projects/-Users-axelfaes-workspace-ordo/`, read only; the reference mattpocock `retro`: github.com/mattpocock/skills at d81f3a1, `skills/engineering/retro/`.
- Plan 2.E runs at the same time from `.scratch/2-e-grill/`; a step of this plan whose paths meet a 2.E step in flight waits for it to land.

## Current position (rewritten before every step commit)

- 2026-09-30. Steps 1, 2 and 3 landed and ticked.
- Step 3a is ruled ("Step 3a, the words of the six changes", (a)) and is prepared once 2.F step 2a has landed, since it changes the rules file and runs alone.
- Next: step 4, the real run over 2.C's sessions with Axel, before 2026-10-28.
